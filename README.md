The Naryan Project is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience. While the project is not responsive, it was created as a learning exercise to enhance my understanding of front-end development concepts.

Feel free to explore, modify, and improve the project as needed!
